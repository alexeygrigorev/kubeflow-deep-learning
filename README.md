# Kubeflow Deep Learning

Deployng a Keras model with KServe (formely KFServing) and EKS

* Here's a detailed step-by-step guide for doing it: [guide.md](guide.md)
* Want to talk about it? Join [DataTalks.Club](https://datatalks.club)
* To learn more about machine learning and deploying models check [Machine Leanring Zoomcamp](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp) - a free course about machine leanring engineering

This tutorial was updated in December 2021 to reflect latest changes:

* KFServing is no longer a part of Kubeflow ecosystem and now is called KServe
* The version if KServe used here is 0.7.0 
* The api version of yaml config files is `serving.kserve.io/v1beta1`
